## About this project

Many of the old meters in 34401a series are still in great working condition,
however their aging VFD displays are failing in various ways. Low contrast,
leaking current in segment drivers, shattered glass are frequent cause of
these excellent devices being written off. While replacement VFDs are
still sold on some markets, they are not cheap and getting them intact in mail
is a lottery. Also replacing the VFD itself does not always resolve the issue
since in some cases it's the driver IC that is at fault. On older issue 34401a
meters (fw version 06-04-01 and prior) have a custom HP designed micro controller
with integrated high voltage VFD driver which is not obtainable, unless bought
as a whole front panel assembly, which again is not cheap.

After acquiring one of such devices off ebay and encountering the leaking driver
issue which lead to artifacts on the screen, a decision was made to rectify
this situation. This project is result of many evenings of carefully reverse
engineering the protocol between the CPU of the meter and it's front panel
controller IC and designing a sniffing device that would extract the data sent
to the front panel and display it on a more modern display instead.

After the protocol was reverse engineered a simple sniffing device based on
everyone's favorite stm32 f1 series micro was designed. First prototype used
a bluepill board and an Arduino compatible 3.5" TFT screen.

After the prototype showed promise it was quickly upgraded to a screen that
would work well inside the meter and a custom board was designed. In the
process a useful fast bargraph feature was added.

### ⚠️ Warning
<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; color: #856404; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #ffeeba;">
Connecting a mains powered PC to the USB interface makes the front end of the meter
no longer floating. Conducting measurements while the meter is connected can lead to
unintended pyrotechnical special effects and magic smoke escaping.
For safe operation make sure to only use the USB interface for flashing the firmware
and disconnect the meter from your PC before performing any measurements.
